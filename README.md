# NBA_MAP_Shiny

I Create a shiny app to be able to make a map react to the choices that you make and then implement a data set. Since NBA data is an easy data source that is organized I thought it was the best type of data to implement the react outputs that I was looking for. There is still a lot that I could do with this app but I felt like what I did was a huge accomplishment. I am looking forward to using this framework for geospatial analysis in the future.
